1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?

    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'

2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quo-tation marks, or both?

    End of line syntax error or missing variable definition
    SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
    NameError: name 'a' is not defined

3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like-2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?

    >>> 2++2
    4
    >>> 2+++2
    4
    >>> 2++++2
    4
    >>> 2++++++2
    4

    It looks like it only cares about the first +

4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?

    SyntaxError: invalid token
    Unless it's declare as a string. x = '02'

5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?

    Unless they are strings, in which case they will be concatenated, one will get "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"
