6. For each of the variables in the following program, indicate the scope. Then determine
what the program prints, without actually running the program.

a = 0
b = 5

def main() :
    global a, b
    i = 10
    b = g(i)
    print(a + b + i)

main will try to execute (a=)0 + (b=g(i)=)None + (i=)10 which will fail because one can't add None and integer

def f(i) :
    n = 0
    while n * n <= i :
        n=n+ 1
    return n - 1

For a given i (in the case of i=0 from the below function) this will likely output (1 - 1 =) 0

def g(a):
    b = 0
    for n in range(a):
        i = f(n)
        b = b + i

This will output None - there is neither print nor return statements
